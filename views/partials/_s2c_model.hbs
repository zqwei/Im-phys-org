  Spike to calcium models can be used to test our understanding of the process bridging
  spikes and calcium imaging.
</p>
<p>
  In the context of simultaneously recorded spiking and imaging
  the synthetic calcium signal generated based on the recorded series of spikes can be
  compared directly to the recorded calcium signals.
</p>
<p>
  In the context of non-simultaneously recorded data, spike to calcium models can
  test how much of the difference between the same analysis performed on a spiking
  data and on an imaging data can be explained by the indirect report
  of activity. A synthetic imaging dataset is generated from the recorded spike trains.
  Then the analysis of interest is applied on the synthetic data and how much of the
  difference between spike and imaging is quantified.

  All of our spike to calcium
  models consists of two steps. First, spikes at times $\{t_k\}$ are converted to a latent variable, $c(t)$,
  by convolution with a double-exponential kernel:
  $$c(t)=\sum_{t>t_k}\exp(-\frac{t-t_k}{\tau_d})[1-\exp(-\frac{t-t_k}{\tau_r})]+n_i(t)$$
  where $\tau_r$and $\tau_d$ are the rise and decay times, respectively. $n_i(t)\sim N(0, \sigma_i^2)$ is Gaussian distributed
  "internal" noise with negative values were set to zero. Second, c(t) was converted to a synthetic
  fluorescence signal through a general function $f(\cdot)$:
  $$F_{synth}(t) = f(c(t)) + n_e(t)$$
  where $n_e(t)\sim N(0, \sigma_e^2)$ is Gaussian distributed "external" noise.
  <br>
  Note that since synthetic data contains no baseline activity, the synthetic imaging data
  itself $F_{synth}(t)$ is the signal that is relevant to compare to $\Delta F/F$
  in data
