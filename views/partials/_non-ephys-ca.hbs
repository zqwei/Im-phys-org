            Individual neurons often exhibit diverse
            temporal dynamics and even change selectivity. We classified neurons into
            three broad categories: ‘monophasic’ neurons showed consistent selectivity
            across the trial; ‘multiphasic’ neurons changed selectivity over
            time; ‘non-selective’ neurons responded similarly across trial
            types but in a task-modulated manner.

          <p>
            For two-alternative force choice task, neural selectivity for type A
            or type B trials was using two-sample t-tests, with neural activity
            binned over 67 ms, which corresponds to one imaging frame (~15Hz).
            A neuron was selective if it showed selectivity (p < .05) for >335 ms
            (5 continuous frames). A selective neuron was multiphasic if the polarity
            of selectivity switched, with periods of selectivity at least 335 ms long.
            Other selective neurons were monophasic. The fraction of each cell type
            is then computed for each recording and model condition.

            Slow and nonlinear dynamics of imaging can lead to a distorted view
            of neuronal dynamics, where 'peaky' neural dynamics at transitions
            between behavioral epochs in ephys seemed to be delayed and jittered,
            causing a sequence-like appearance in imaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ‘peakiness’ of the distribution of neuronal activity (‘s’) across
            recording modalities were measured as the difference between observed
            neural activity and temporally uniformly distributed neural activity ($P=\frac{1}{2T}$;
            T is the length of the recording/task):
            $$s=\frac{1}{P}\sqrt{P\sum_{i=A,B}\int_0^T dt(P_i(t)-P)^2}$$

              Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied on neural dynamics grouped
              into bins corresponding to single imaging frames (67 ms) to compute the
              instantaneous decodability of trial type. The optimal LDA decoder was
              computed separately for each time bin, using correct trials.
              We estimated performance for the instantaneous LDA decoder by sampling a
              subset of units (10-200), and averaging 100 samplings. We separated
              the trials of each neuron into non-overlapping training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.
              We then shuffled trial identity of each neuron to build up random collections
              of population activity at each time point for correct trial A (50% in training and testing)
              and trial B using all recorded neurons. The instantaneous decoder of trial type was
              computed from training set and its performance was evaluated on the testing set.

              To achieve robust estimation given the large number of neurons, we applied a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/RDA-6.pdf">sparse version of LDA</a>.

              Principal component analysis (PCA) finds modes of population activity
              that capture the largest amount of variance in neural activity. This method
              usually handles the first pipeline of data processing for large-scale dataset.
              Data visualization and analysis are often performed after truncating the
              decomposition after a few components. Accordingly, if the recording method results
              in a change in the relative ranking of different sources of variance, this truncation
              will throw out different sources of variance.

              In this study, PCA was performed on the activity of neurons averaged
              across two alternative trial types ($s\in\{A, B\}$):
              $$\mathbf{r}(s,t)=\mathbf{Cx}(s,t)+\langle\mathbf{r}(s,t)\rangle_{s,t}$$
              $\mathbf{r}$ is a $n\times 2T$ matrix, where n is the number of recorded
              units in each dataset and T is the number of time points for each trial type.
              $<\mathbf{r}(s,t)>_{s,t}$ a vector of the mean activity of each neuron across time and trial types.
              $\mathbf{x}(s,t)$ is an $n\times 2T$ PC score matrix, where the $i$th row corresponds to the $i$th
              PC score. We estimated the relative contribution to each PC of the different forms of variance:
              temporal dynamics, trial-type selectivity and other. Explained variance (EV) of temporal dynamics
              $EV_i(t)$ and trial-type selectivity $EV_i(s)$ for the th principal component (PC) were computed as:
              $$EV_i(t)=\langle\langle x_i(s,t)\rangle_s^2\rangle_t/\langle x_i(s,t)^2\rangle_{s,t}$$
              $$EV_i(t)=\langle\langle x_i(s,t)\rangle_t^2\rangle_s/\langle x_i(s,t)^2\rangle_{s,t}$$
              respectively.
