## Git management
* merge your own branch with updated master (Do at your own git)
```bash
    git merge master
```
* Send a pull request to merge your own branch to master (Do with a pull request)

## Code architecture
### Frontend
Static file folders:
* public/semantic-ui: for support of frontend framework (not tracked git).
* public/results: for static benchmarks (not tracked in git).

### Backend
* Backend of the website is implemented by Node.Js and MongoDB (3.4).
    * install MongoDB (Data format is upgraded after MongoDB 4.0 -- http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/4.0-upgrade-fcv)
    ```bash
    brew install mongodb@3.4
    sudo mkdir -p /data/db
    sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mongodb@3.4/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    ```
    * start MongoDB connections
    ```bash
    mongod
    ```
    * run MongoDB
    ```bash
    mongo
    ```
    * GUI for MongoDB -- __Robo 3T__
    * _TODO_: render data from MongoDB to each html when __get__ request is sent.

* Set up of MongoDB
    * set path to current project folder
    ```bash
    mongod --dbpath <project_folder>/data
    ```
    * copy ephys_imaging_datasets dataset to current MongoDB
    ```bash
    mongorestore -d ephys_imaging_datasets <location_for_dumped file>
    ```

## Testing website on a local server

### Set up local server at project folder
1. Install Node
2. Run
```bash
    npm install
```
3. Start server
```bash
    npm start
```
4. It will show the website at local and external addresses ended with port 10001

### Install other node packages

```bash
    npm install mathjax --save
```

## Run `Gulp` to monitor the changes online

### Set up gulp
Gulp configure file and task file are `gulpfile.js` and `gulp_task/serve.js` files respectively.

Before starting gulp, one needs to install global command of `gulp` and `nodemon`.
```bash
    npm install -g nodemon
    npm install --save-dev nodemon
    npm install -g gulp
```

## Basic function in `Git`
* Create a new branch
```bash
    git checkout -b <branch name>
```

* Update your branch with master branch
```bash
    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout <your branch>
    git merge master
```

* Delete your branch
```bash
    git checkout master # switch to any branches which is not to be deleted
    git branch -d <your branch>
```
